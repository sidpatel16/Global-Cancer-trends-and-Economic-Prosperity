# Global Cancer Trends & Economic Prosperity Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between a country's economic status (measured by GDP per Capita) and its cancer statistics. Using data from 2022, the analysis investigates whether higher economic prosperity correlates with lower cancer incidence or mortality rates.

## Research Questions
* How does a country’s GDP per capita affect cancer incidence rates?
* How does GDP per capita impact cancer mortality rates?
* Is there a correlation between national wealth and the Mortality-to-Incidence Ratio (MIR)?

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes data from the year 2022, sourced from:
* World Cancer Research Fund: Cancer incidence and Age-Standardized Rates (ASR).
* World Health Organization (WHO): Cancer mortality data.
* Worldometer: GDP per Capita and population size.

## Methodology
Data was cleaned and consolidated using Excel and visualized in Tableau. To ensure fair comparisons across countries with different demographics, the following metrics were used:
* ASR (Age-Standardized Rate): Incidence/Mortality per 100,000 people, adjusted for age.
* MIR (Mortality-to-Incidence Ratio): Calculated as 'ASR Mortality / ASR Incidence'. A higher MIR suggests a lower survival rate.

## Key Findings
1. Incidence vs. GDP: Contrary to the initial hypothesis, Cancer Incidence ASR increases as GDP per Capita increases. This suggests that wealthier nations likely have better healthcare access and diagnostic tools, leading to higher reporting rates.
2. Mortality vs. GDP: There is no single linear trend for total mortality; however, specific outliers exist (e.g., Mongolia shows exceptionally high mortality).
3. The Wealth Gap in Survival (MIR): There is a clear trend where **MIR decreases as GDP per Capita increases**. Wealthier nations demonstrate a significantly better ability to treat cancer and prevent mortality after diagnosis compared to lower-income nations.
